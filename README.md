**Latest version:** The latest version of **circuitSymbols** is **1.0**. This version is compatible with Inkscape 1.0 and up only. It is **incompatible** with older Inkscape versions!

**Older versions:** If you have an older version of Inkscape, please use the files under the folder **0.9x** on Github.

**Important: Only the latest version will receive updates, new features, and bug fixes! The usage section in this documentation describes the latest version. In older versions, the disposition of the elements in the plugin's screen might be different. Some features might not be present or have different behavior.**

# Installation and requirements

Installation procedures for latest and older versions are described below.

## Requirements (all versions)

- You will need [inkscapeMadeEasy](https://github.com/fsmMLK/inkscapeMadeEasy) plugin installed. Check the compatibility table above to know the version you need.

## Installation procedure (v1.0 only)

**circuitSymbols** was developed using Inkscape 1.0 in Linux (Kubuntu 18.04). It should work in different OSs too as long as all requirements are met.

1. Install [inkscapeMadeEasy](https://github.com/fsmMLK/inkscapeMadeEasy), **version 1.0** (latest). Follow the instructions in the manual page. **Note:** LaTeX text is used in **circuitSymbols** if the support is activated (nicer results), otherwise regular text elements will be used.

2. **circuitSymbols** installation

    1. Go to Inkscape's extension directory with a file browser. Your inkscape extension directory can be accessed by opening Inkscape and selecting ``Edit > Preferences > System``. Look for the item **User Extensions**  field. There is a button on the right of the field  that will open a file explorer window in that specific folder.

    2. Create a subfolder in the extension directory with the name ``circuitSymbols``. **Important:**  Be careful with upper and lower case letters. You must write as presented above.

    3. Download **circuitSymbols** files and place them inside the directory you just created.

       You don't have to copy all files from Github. The files you will need are inside the ``latest`` folder. In the end you must have the following files and directories in your Inkscape extension directory.

       **LaTeX users:** the file `circuitSymbolsPreamble.tex` contains the macros defined in this plugin. You can add your own macros to this file. You can also add macros to ``inkscapeMadeEasy/basicLatexPackages.tex``. In this case the same macros will be accessible by all plugins that employ inkscapeMadeEasy.

## Installation procedure (v0.9x only)

**circuitSymbols** was developed using Inkscape 0.48 and 0.91 in Linux (Kubuntu 18.04). It should work in different OSs too as long as all requirements are met.

1. Install [inkscapeMadeEasy](https://github.com/fsmMLK/inkscapeMadeEasy), **version 1.0** (latest). Follow the instructions in the manual page. **Note:** LaTeX text is used in **circuitSymbols** if the support is activated (nicer results), otherwise regular text elements will be used.

2. **circuitSymbols** installation

    1. Go to Inkscape's extension directory with a file browser.

    2. Download **circuitSymbols** files and place them inside the directory you just created.

       You don't have to copy all files from Github. The files you will need are inside the ``0.9x`` folder. In the end you must have the following files and directories in your Inkscape extension directory.

# Usage

This extension is presented in two menu entries: **General** and **Semiconductor**. Both can be found under `extensions > fsmMLK > Circuit symbols` menu.

The first generates symbols of commonly used circuit elements like resistors, capacitors, inductors, switches and various independent and dependent voltage/current sources.

The second generates semiconductor elements like diodes, transistors and operational amplifiers.

Each entry has several tabs. Depending on which tab is on top, the extension will create different elements in your document as soon as you click on `Apply` button (or check `live preview`).

In addition to these elements, both menu entries has extra tabs to generate signal labels and annotations. They are repeated in both entries to facilitate its use.

# GENERAL menu entry


## RLC tab

In this tab you can create resistors, capacitors, inductors and fuses. The section **Voltage and current indications** serves to add voltage or current annotation arrows to the symbol and adjust their orientations.

<img src="docs/images/Tab_RLC.png" width="450px"/>

**Type:** You can select the type of bipole. The available types are:

<img src="docs/images/RLC_types.png" width="800px"/>

**Important:**  2-terminal potentiometer option was removed. You can have the same symbol with resistor + 'Variable' option turned on.

**Standard:** Here you can choose the standard. There are two options, IEEE Std 315-1975 (american) and IEC 60167 (europe). This option affects RLC tab only.

**Orientation:** Rotation angle in degrees.

<img src="docs/images/RLC_orientation.png" width="600px"/>


**Extra wire length:** You can adjust the length of the wires. You can choose any integer number between -10 and 10. (Defaults is 0).

> Note: Keep in mind that negative numbers can cause current arrow indication to overlap other elements of the symbol. You can manually adjust if needed.

<img src="docs/images/WireExtraLength.png" width="400px"/>

**Value:** Literal or numeric value of the bipole. If you type numeric values, you can use ``M,k,m,u,n,p`` to indicate multiplier unit. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. Also for LaTeX, there are a couple of functions to specify values in terms of complex impedances. See image below for examples.

**Variable:** If selected, adds variable arrow on top of the symbol. This option has no effect in fuses and 3-terminal potentiometers.

<img src="docs/images/RLC_variable" width="700px"/>

**Add unit:** If selected, unit will be automatically added to the value. The unit will be selected accordingly with the type (ohm for resistors and generic bipole (impedance), farad for capacitors, henry for inductors).

> Note: If LaTeX support is enabled, the unit will be inserted using ``siunitx`` package.

<img src="docs/images/RLC_values.png" width="800px"/>

### **Voltage and current indications section**

## Sources tab

In this tab you can create voltage and current sources. The sources can be independent or dependent (contolled).

This tab contains two subtabs, *Independent* and *Dependent*. The 'Apply' button will execute the action associated to the subtab that is on the top.

There is also a common section called **Voltage and current indications** that will serve both types of sources to add voltage or current annotation arrows to the symbol and adjust their orientations.

**Symmetric supply:** Force symmetric supply. This parameter has effect only if `Add supply values` is checked. See image below

**+V/-V supply label:** positive/negative supply values. -V is used only if `Symmetric supply` is unchecked.  See image below

### **Voltage and current indications section**

**Add (v+) (v-) indications:** add input nodal voltage indications.  On the side there are fields for the labels of the indications. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. See image below.

**Add (i+) (i-) indications:** add input current indications. On the side there are fields for the labels of the indications. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. See image below.

**Add V_out indication:** add output nodal voltage indication. On the side there is a text field for the label of the indication. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. See image below.

**Add I_out indication:** add output current indication. On the side there is a text field for the label of the indication. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. See image below

**Add V_d indication:** add input differential voltage indication. On the side there is a text field for the label of the indication. If LaTeX support is enabled, this text will be included in a math environment $...$. See image below

This tab is identical to the tab with the same name on GENERAL menu entry. Check the documentation there.


# Observations

 - The objects will be created in the center of your screen.

 - In the file `circuitSymbolsPreamble.tex` you can add LaTeX macros and extra packages. A few functions were define there:

# Changelog

**2022-02feb-19**

- Added variable RLC components
- Added variable independent sources
- Added old current source symbol (two circles)
- Added insulated gate bipolar transistor (NPN and PNP)
- Removed 2-terminal potentiometer. Now you can create the same symbol with Resistor + variable indication
